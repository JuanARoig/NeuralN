# NeuralN: A Basic FeedForward Neural Network
This demonstrates a basic neural network taking data from two generic lists of input arrays.
The first generic list contains input data. The second contains output labels.

## Abstract
Lines 28 - 103 take care of initializing weights, biases, and holder variables for those weights and biases to hold updates
from gradient optimizers before they can be assigned to their respective weights and biases. Optimization happens with respect to the
error function defined on line 237. Gradient opimization is done in pieces.
